# Scala Object

- Object is a class, but already has a instance..
- cannot call "new" keyword
- object create singleton class
- should have one main(args: Array[String]) method

# String Interpolation

- means replace a defined variable in string with some value
  `println(name + " is " + age + " years old")
  println(s"$name is $age years old")
  println(f"$name%s is $age%.2f years old")
  println(raw"$name%s is $age%.2f years old \n Test")`

- raw interpolation - println(raw"$name%s is $age%.2f years old \n Test")
  prints raw structure

# Ifelse expressions

`val x = 20 println(if (x == 210) "x == 20" else "x != 20")`
refer to "Demo1.scala" object file

# while loop and do-while loop

x++, x--, ++x, --x NOT allowed in SCALA syntax as-is in JAVA refer to "Demo2 .scala" object file

# for loop

syntax - for( var a <- Range){ statements }

- Range using keyword "to" can be given like "1 to 5"
- Range using keyword "until" can be given "<- 0 until(5)"
  **until method skips the last number, unlike range**

- for loop with list is also possible
- for loop for filtering
- for loop as expression with keyword "yield", gives a Vector

# Match Expression in Scala - similar to switch*case

- default case is given as underscore "_"
  refer to "Demo4 .scala" object file

# Functions

syntax - def Function-name(arg1:datatype, arg2:datatype) : "datatype of return" = { }

* last line of function in Scala is by default considered as return value.

`Syntax 1 - def add(x:Double, y:Double) : Double = { return x + y }

Syntax 2 - def subtract(lhs_number: Double, rhs_number: Double) : Double = { lhs_number - rhs_number }

Syntax 3 - def multiply(lhs_number: Double, rhs_number: Double) : Double = lhs_number * rhs_number

Syntax 4 - def divide(lhs_number: Double, rhs_number: Double): Double = lhs_number / rhs_number`

Syntactical sugar if the function has only 1 argument, it can be called like "(Object Func Arg)"
`example - def square(x: Double) : Double = x*x println(Functions square 5)`

refer to "Demo5 .scala" object file

# More on functions

- default values to functional arguments is also possible in Scala
- in case of default values, the arguments are assign as per position

Unit is equivalent to "Void" in Java - no return from function Use operator(*, /, - etc...) as a function name

refer to "Demo5 .scala" object file

# Anonymous function

- functions without names
- assign to variables
- if required, variables takes arguments of the anonymous function

`var sumx: (Int, Int) => Int = (x: Int, y: Int) => x + y`

refer to "Demo6 .scala" object file

# Higher Order functions in Scala

- function which are able to take functions as argument and return function
  `  def math1(x: Double, y: Double, z: Double, f: Functions.type ) : Double = Functions.subtract(Functions.subtract(x, y), z)`

- Wildcard in SCALA => _ , _ + _, _ - _, _ min _, _ max _

refer to "Demo7 .scala" object file

# Partially applied functions

- incomplete function with a wildcard "_" : datatype
- separate method is build to implement to the wildcard

real time application of this

`def sum = (x:Int, y:Int, z:Int) => x + y + z def f = sum(50, 60, _:Int)
println(f(170))`

refer to "Demo8 .scala" object file

# Closures

- its a function, which uses one or more functions declared outside this function. Impure and Pure closure - When the
  variable is of type var its impure, and pure mein val

refer to "Demo9 .scala" object file

# Currying

- its a mechanism by which, you convert a function which accept multiple arguments, to function accept only 1 argument.
  `  def sum (x: Int) = (y: Int) => x + y println(sum(5)(8))
  def sum (x: Int) (y: Int) = x + y`

- partial applied functions possible with curried function
  ` def sum2 = sum(40)
  println(sum2(100))`

refer to "Demo10 .scala" object file

# Strings in Scala

String is Scala have same behaviour as String in JAVA

`val str = "STRING"
println(str.charAt(5))
println(str.length)
println(str.concat("text"))
println(str + " Hello World")`

- String formatting
  `  val str = "STRING"
  printf("%s\n", str)
  println("%s".format(str))`

# SCALA Arrays

Arrays is a data structure, **fixed sized**, sequential elements of **same data type**.
`var myArray: Array[Int] = new Array[Int](5)
var myArray1 = new Array[Double](5)
var myArray2 = Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)`

- Array Concatenation
  `val myArray4 = myArray.concat(myArray2)`

refer to "Demo12 .scala" object file

# SCALA List

- Similar to SCALA Array, can hold same data type
- **List are immutable**

val list : List[Int] = List(1,2,3,23)
val names : List[String] = List("Max", "Tom", "Harry")

- cannot append the same list, need to use cons "::" to append a list at 0th position and assign whole list to new
  variable
  `val mylist3 = 0 :: mylist1`

- to add to end of list use "append"
  refer to "Demo13 .scala" object file

# SCALA Sets

- Sets are list without duplicate values
- 2 types - Mutable Set & Immutable Sets
- sets are not ordered & hence not indexed

`  // Immutable sets val myset: Set[Int] = Set(1, 12, 123, 123, 123, 124, 234, 1, 234)
val names = Set("Tom", "Dick", "Harry")`

`  // Mutable sets var myset1: mutable.Set[Int] = scala.collection.mutable.Set(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)`

- Concatenate 2 sets will give unique value from 2 sets
- Intersection will give common values of 2 sets
  ` val myset3 = myset2.concat(myset1)
  println(myset3)`

  ` val myset4 = myset2.intersect(myset1)
  println(myset4)`
  refer to "Demo14 .scala" object file

# SCALA Map

- key value a pair of datatype
- mutable
- immutable
- duplicate keys not possible in Map

`val myMap0 = Map(1 -> "One", 2 -> "Two", 3 -> "Three", 3 -> "Threeeeeee")
var myMap1 = Map(4 -> "Four", 5 -> "Five", 6 -> "Six")`

`myMap1.+=(7 -> "Seven", 8 -> "Eight")
println(myMap1)`

# SCALA Tuples

`val myTuple = (1, 2, "Test", true, false)
val myTupel1 = Tuple2("Hello", "World")`

- can contain data of different data type -> heterogeneous in nature
- immutable in SCALA
- only 22 value are possible

Tuple elements will be assigned with "_number" as per position in tuple. use if to access the element.

- special for loop case for (x <- myTuple.productIterator) { println(x)
  } refer to "Demo16 .scala" object file

# SCALA Options

- its a container, which gives 2 values
- return instance of some and none

1. find options for list

2. get options for Map

3. getOrElse to manage exceptions

`println(myList.find(_ > 3).get)
println(myMap.getOrElse(5, "Not in Range"))`

refer to "Demo17 .scala" object file

# SCALA map and filters method for Collections

map - will iterate over all elements
`println(myList.map( _ + 2 ))
println(myMap.map(_._2 + "_mapTest"))`

- Flatten method to combine list of lists
  `var myListofList = List(List(1,2,3), List(3,4,5,6))
  println(myListofList.flatten)`
  Output - List(1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6)

- Filter use a predicate (function returns a boolean value)

refer to "Demo17 .scala" object file

# Scala Reduce, Fold or Scan (left or right) methods

- Reduce left and right
  Binary operator -> a function which work on 1st 2 element and result of which is passed to 3rd element and so on
  
- Fold left and right
  Provide initial element + Binary operator -> a function which work on initial element & 1st element and result of which is passed to 3rd element and so on

# Lazy Evaluation
Similar to lazy attributes definition in SCALA REPL, when lazy attributes are defined @Class level, are not instantiated before been initiated in object.
refer to "Demo18 .scala" object file

# Lazy Evaluation - Call by Name Parameter
Methods in scala can call methods by name and the value is evaluated when the methods are called
syntax method( argument : => datatype) rocket sign is symbol of lazy evaluation.
